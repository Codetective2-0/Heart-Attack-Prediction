# Heart-Attack-Prediction
Recursion 2.0 Hackathon Project 2021. (Machine Learning based Project)
Recursion 2.0 Hackathon had been orgainsed by RGIT, Mumbai via virtual mode.

# Installations : 
A lot of libraries have been imported. Kindly check your pc has all of them installed. Else, you can use GOOGLE COLABORATORY
The .ipynb file has been created using Google Colaboratory, which is an open source jupyter notebook. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.
When we run the code, we have to upload the dataset file (.csv file).

# Details of the Project:
4 Machine Learning Algorthims were used :
  1. K-Nearest Neighbors 
  2. Support Vector Machine
  3. Random Forest Clasification
  4. Logistic Regression
